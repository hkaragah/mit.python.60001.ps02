    "\n",
    "Implement the function hangman , which takes one parameter the `secret_word` the user is to guess. Initially, you should manually set this secret word when you run this function – this will make it easier to test your code. But in the end, you will want the computer to select this secret word at random before inviting you or some other user to play the game by running this function.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling the hangman function starts up an interactive game of Hangman between the user and the computer. In designing your code, be sure you take advantage of the three helper functions, `is_word_guessed` , `get_guessed_word` , and `get_available_letters` , that you've defined in the previous part!<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the game requirements broken down in different categories. Make sure your implementation fits all the requirements!<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "#### Game Requirements\n",
    "**A. Game Architecture:**\n",
    "1. The computer must select a word at random from the list of available words that was provided in `words.txt`. The functions for loading the word list and selecting a random word have already been provided for you in hangman.py.<br>\n",
    "2. Users start with 6 guesses.<br>\n",
    "3. At the start of the game, let the user know how many letters the computer's word contains and how many guesses s/he starts with.<br>\n",
    "4. The computer keeps track of all the letters the user has not guessed so far and before each turn shows the user the “remaining letters”<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Game Implementation:**\n",
    "`Loading word list from file...`<br>\n",
    "`55900 words loaded.`<br>\n",
    "`Welcome to the game Hangman!`<br>\n",
    "`I am thinking of a word that is 4 letters long.`<br>\n",
    "`-------------`<br>\n",
    "`You have 6 guesses left.`<br>\n",
    "`Available letters: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "**B. UserComputer Interaction:**\n",
    "The game must be interactive and flow as follows:<br>\n",
    "1. Before each guess, you should display to the user:<br>\n",
    "    a. Remind the user of how many guesses s/he has left after each guess.<br>\n",
    "    b. all the letters the user has not yet guessed<br>\n",
    "2. Ask the user to supply one guess at a time. (Look at the user input requirements below to see what types of inputs you can expect from the user)<br>\n",
    "3. Immediately after each guess, the user should be told whether the letter is in the computer’s word.<br>\n",
    "4. After each guess, you should also display to the user the computer’s word, with guessed letters displayed and unguessed letters replaced with an underscore and space (_ )<br>\n",
    "5. At the end of the guess, print some dashes (-----) to help separate individual guesses from each other<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Game Implementation:**\n",
    "(The <font color = blue> blue </font> color below is only there to show you what the user typed in, as opposed to what the computer output.)<br>\n",
    "    \n",

    "`Oops! That letter is not in my word: _ a_ _`<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "**C. User Input Requirements:**\n",
    "1. You may assume that the user will only guess one character at a time, but the user can choose any number, symbol or letter. Your code should accept capital and lowercase letters as valid guesses!<br>\n",
    "2. If the user inputs anything besides an alphabet (symbols, numbers), tell the user that they can only input an alphabet. Because the user might do this by accident, they should get 3 warnings at the beginning of the game. Each time they enter an invalid input, or a letter they have already guessed, they should lose a warning. If the user has no warnings left and enters an invalid input, they should lose a guess.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    ">*Hint #1:* Use calls to the input function to get the user’s guess.<br>\n",
    "* Check that the user input is an alphabet<br>\n",
    "* If the user does not input an uppercase or lowercase alphabet letter, subtract one warning or one guess.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    ">*Hint #2:* you may find the string functions `str.isalpha`(‘your string’) and `str.lower` (‘Your String’) helpful! If you don’t know what these functions are you could try typing `help(str.isalpha)` or `help(str.lower)` in your Spyder shell to see the documentation for the functions.\n",
    "\n",
    ">*Hint #3:* Since the words in `words.txt` are lowercase, it might be easier to convert the user input to lowercase at all times and have your game only handle lowercase.<br>\n",

    "**Example Game Implementation:**\n",
    "`You have 3 warnings left.`<br>\n",
    "`You have 6 guesses left.`<br>\n",

    "`Oops! That is not a valid letter. You have 2 warnings left: _ a_ _`<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "**D. Game Rules:**<br>\n",
    "1. The user starts with 3 warnings.<br>\n",
    "2. If the user inputs anything besides an alphabet (symbols, numbers), tell the user that they can only input an alphabet.<br>\n",
    "    a. If the user has one or more warning left, the user should lose one warning. Tell the user the number of remaining warnings.<br>\n",
    "    b. If the user has no remaining warnings, they should lose one guess.<br>\n",
    "3. If the user inputs a letter that has already been guessed, print a message telling the user the letter has already been guessed before.<br>\n",
    "    a. If the user has one or more warning left, the user should lose one warning. Tell the user the number of remaining warnings.<br>\n",
    "    b. If the user has no warnings, they should lose one guess.<br>\n",
    "4. If the user inputs a letter that hasn’t been guessed before and the letter is in\n",
    "the secret word, the user loses no guesses.<br>\n",
    "5. Consonants: If the user inputs a consonant that hasn’t been guessed and the\n",
    "consonant is not in the secret word, the user loses one guess if it’s a consonant.\n",
    "6. Vowels: If the vowel hasn’t been guessed and the vowel is not in the secret\n",
    "word, the user loses two guesses. Vowels are a, e, i , o, and u. y does not\n",
    "count as a vowel.<br>\n",

    "`ta_ t`<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "**E. Game Termination:**\n",
    "1. The game should end when the user constructs the full word or runs out of guesses.<br>\n",
    "2. If the player runs out of guesses before completing the word, tell them they lost and reveal the word to the user when the game ends.<br>\n",
    "3. If the user wins, print a congratulatory message and tell the user their score.<br>\n",
    "4. The total score is the number of guesses_remaining once the user has guessed the secret_word times the number of unique letters in secret_word .<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total score = guesses_remaining* number unique letters in secret_word**<br>\n",

    "***\n",
    "**F. General Hints:**<br>\n",
    "1. Consider writing additional helper functions if you need them.<br>\n",
    "2. There are four important pieces of information you may wish to store:<br>\n",
    "* `secret_word` : The word to guess. This is already used as the parameter name for the hangman function.<br>\n",
    "* `letters_guessed` : The letters that have been guessed so far. If they guess a letter that is already in `letters_guessed` , you should print a message telling them they've already guessed that but do not penalize them for it.<br>\n",
    "* `guesses_remaining` : The number of guesses the user has left. Note that in our example game, the penalty for choosing an incorrect vowel is different than the penalty for choosing an incorrect consonant.<br>\n",
    "* `warnings_remaining` : The number of warnings the user has left. Note that a user only loses a warning for inputting either a symbol or a letter that has already been guessed.<br>\n",

    "### Hangman Part 3: The Game with Hints <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have tried playing Hangman against the computer, you may have noticed that it isn’t always easy to beat the computer, especially when it selects an esoteric word (like “esoteric”!). It might be nice if you could ask the computer for a hint, such as a list of all the words that match what you have currently guessed.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the hidden word is “`tact`”, and you have so far guessed the letter “t”, so that you know the solution is “`t_ _ t`”, where you need to guess the two missing letters, it might be nice to know that the set of matching words (at least based on what the computer initially loaded) are:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    " `tact tart taut teat tent test text that tilt tint toot tort tout trot tuft twit`\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to have you create a variation of Hangman (we call this `hangman_with_hints` , and have provided an initial scaffold for writing it), with the property that if you guess the special character * the computer will find all the words from its loaded list that might match your current guessed word, and print out each of them. Of course, we don’t recommend trying this at the first step, since this will print out all 55,900 words that we loaded! But if you are getting close to an answer and are running out of guesses, this might help.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "To do this, we are going to ask you to first complete two helper functions:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3A) Matching the current guessed word<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "`match_with_gaps` takes two parameters: `my_word` and `other_word`. my_word is an instance of a guessed word, in other words, it may have some _ ’s in places (such as ‘`t_ _ t`’). `other_word` is a normal English word.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This function should return True if the guessed letters of `my_word` match the corresponding letters of `other_word` . It should return `False` if the two words are not of the same length or if a guessed letter in `my_word` does not match the corresponding character in `other_word`.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that when a letter is guessed, your code reveals all the positions at which that letter occurs in the secret word. Therefore, the hidden letter (_ ) cannot be one of the letters in the word that has already been revealed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Usage:**<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "`>>> match_with_gaps(\"te_ t\", \"tact\")`<br>\n",
    "`False`<br>\n",
    "`>>> match_with_gaps(\"a_ _ le\", \"banana\")`<br>\n",
    "`False`<br>\n",
    "`>>> match_with_gaps(\"a_ _ le\", \"apple\")`<br>\n",
    "`True`<br>\n",
    "`>>> match_with_gaps(\"a_ ple\", \"apple\")`<br>\n",
    "`False`<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** You may want to use `replace()` to get rid of the spaces in the word to compare lengths.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "#### 3B) Showing all possible matches<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "`show_possible_matches` takes a single parameter: `my_word` which is an instance of a guessed word, in other words, it may have some _ ’s in places (such as ‘`t_ _ t`’).<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This function should print out all words in wordlist (notice where we have defined this at the beginning of the file, line 51) that match `my_word` . It should print “`No matches found`” if there are no matches.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Usage:**<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "`>>> show_possible_matches(\"t_ _ t\")`<br>\n",
    "`tact tart taut teat tent test text that tilt tint toot tort tout trot tuft twit`<br>\n",
    "`>>> show_possible_matches(\"abbbb_ \")`<br>\n",
    "`No matches found`<br>\n",
    "`>>> show_possible_matches(\"a_ pl_ \")`<br>\n",
    "`ample amply`<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "#### 3C) Hangman with hints<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you should be able to replicate the code you wrote for hangman as the body of `hangman_with_hints` , then make a small addition to allow for the case where the user can guess an asterisk (*), in which case the computer will print out all the words that match that guess.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The user should not lose a guess if the guess is an asterisk.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Comment out the lines of code you used to play the original Hangman game:<br>\n",
    "`secret_word = choose_word(wordlist)`<br>\n",
    "`hangman(secret_word)`<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "And uncomment out these lines of code we’ve provided at the bottom of the file to play your new game Hangman with Hints:<br>\n",
    "`#secret_word = choose_word(wordlist)`<br>\n",
    "`#hangman_with_hints(secret_word)`<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Output:**<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The output from guessing an asterisk should look like the sample output below. All other output should follow the Hangman game described in Part 2 above.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "`Loading word list from file...`<br>\n",
    "`55900 words loaded.`<br>\n",
